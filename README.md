# Considerations when deciding on a blockchain Platform

## 1.  Network

- Scale?  How much participants on the network
- Trust? Do we need to know everything about them or is KYC not needed

## 2. Performance
- Amount of transactions and data for transactions
- Throughput - # of TX at a time 
   * Create and modify data
   * Querying data 

## 3. Business Logic
- Standalone solution?
- Data privacy considerations - Should different actors be able to see each others   data?

## 4. Consensus
- Arbitrator needed?
- Who validates transactions?
- Immutability of records
  * Amend or cancel?


## Data Storage
- Store transactional data only or must we store other data as well? Might not want to do heavy data persistance on the blockchain
- Private or public data
